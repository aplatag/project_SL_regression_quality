## Simple Linear Regression Assumptions:

# Outlier:
The term anomaly indicates that there is data that deviates significantly from the rest.
# Normality:
Normality refers to the normal distribution of errors or residuals.
# Homoscedasticity:
Homoscedasticity is another simple linear regression assumption and indicates whether the variance of the residuals is the same across different groups in the database.
# Independence:
Independence refers to the absence of temporal correlation between residuals.
# Linearity:
Linearity is associated with the presence of a constant change of the variable to be predicted with respect to the predictor.
